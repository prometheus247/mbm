MBM - Multi Bot Maintainer

The MBM is a script to maintain order with several bots running https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot at a time.
Its designed to run as "brainless" as possible, doing the thinking while you can concentrate on other things.

It is designed to react on circumstances relevant to the Bot. We are building on a "Sick" detection, or will restart the bot if it crashed.

It is suggested to run the script as cronjob every 15 minutes if the manual execution satisfied you.
